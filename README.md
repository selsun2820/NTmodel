### The Impact of Non-tipping Business Model on Texas Roadhouse Restaurants’ Operations and Financial Performance

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Texas Roadhouse restaurants are suitable for the Non-Tipping model from three persepcitves,  customer flow, restaurant revenue, and employee satisfaction .

The research began with cluster sampling 30 samples will be chosen from a total of 300 Texas Roadhouse restaurants operating in the Conventional Tipping model across the United States for this study. The treatment group will implement a non-tipping (NT) model, in which restaurants abandon the customary tipping system in favor of raising menu prices and server salaries. The control group will use a conventional-tipping (CT) model, in which restaurants continue to operate as usual.

A survey will be done to assess employees’ intentions to work on a scale from 0 to 10, and data such as end-month profit and average number of customers received by restaurants will be gathered. To test the research’s hypothesis, two-sample t-tests will be utilized to compare the difference in the effect of treatments on dependent variables of interest. The process and result of the simulation in the second part can serve as a reference for future experiments.
